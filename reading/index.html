    <p>Much like <a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/computer-science-taught-me-that-books-werent-important-it-was-wrong-63ead2fdad7a">my advisor</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get back into reading books after a hiatus implicitly imposed by engineering and computer science curricula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and then by being busy.
A side effect of the double-whammy of quarantine and exploration of my gender expression/identity, however, is that I&rsquo;ve had to cut pretty much everything that doesn&rsquo;t give me space/energy/spoons during restful time so I don&rsquo;t have a meltdown halfway through the week. Oodles and oodles of fun. This hasn&rsquo;t been all bad &ndash; I&rsquo;m doing more yoga, meditation, tarot readings, basically a smörgåsbord of femme PNW actives (I know, I&rsquo;ve really come into my own).
TV&rsquo;s become a bit too overstimulating, unfort, as has <em>surfing the internet</em>, so I&rsquo;ve had to resort more to books and music than I have in a while<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been leaning away from Spotify towards
<a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and so most of my
music interests post-2015 are over there, but Goodreads is
just so damn terrible; I just want a little virtual
bookshelf that&rsquo;s not being scraped and productized. And,
hey, I&rsquo;m proud of myself for finally getting into books,
which feels like such a weird thing to say, but I&rsquo;ve had so
many on and off points of reading in my life that I&rsquo;m really
enjoying some stability here.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-reading-now">What I&rsquo;m Reading Now</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Dune Messiah</em>, Frank Herbert</li>
<li><em>Manifestingly Haraway</em>, Donna J. Haraway. The Cyborg
Manifesto is absolutely amazing, in the way that somewhat
dense, philosophical, deeply metaphorical academic writing
can be profoundly empowering &ndash; this is a collection of
that essay (which I&rsquo;ve read a few times, but wanted a copy
that wasn&rsquo;t a PDF printout), The Companion Species
Manifesto, and an interview transcript; it seemed fun.</li>
<li><em>When Things Fall Apart</em>, Pema Chödrön.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-id-like-to-read-soon">What I&rsquo;d like to read Soon</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Woman on the Edge of Time</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Bell Jar</em>, Sylvia Plath (in part for the fig tree
quote, in part because the twins in Happiest Season wanted
<em>The Complete Collected works of Sylvia Plath</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, Donald Norman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness</em>, Simone
Browne</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Race After the Internet</em>, Lisa Nakamura</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Design Justice</em>, Sasha Costanza-Chock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Thinking in Systems: A Primer</em>, Meadows &amp; Wright</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saving Capitalism</em>, Robert Reich</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>All About Love</em>, bell hooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Galapagos</em>, Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Exit</em>, Jean-Paul Sartre. I&rsquo;ve been quoting &ldquo;hell is
other people&rdquo; for a while now and it&rsquo;s always more fun to
have the original context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NYT 2020 editors picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Uncanny Valley</em>, Anna Wiener</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Vanishing Half</em>, Brit Bennett</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Homeland Elegies</em>, Ayad Akhtar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uncomfortable Labels: My life as a Gay Autistic Trans Woman</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>An Incomplete List of Names</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-ive-finished-somewhat-recently">What I&rsquo;ve finished somewhat recently</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Kaibyo: The Supernatural Cats of Japan</em>, Zack Davidson.</li>
<li><em>Mrs Dalloway</em>, Virginia Woolf</li>
<li><em>Breakfast with Buddha</em>, Roland Merullo. My mom thought
that it&rsquo;d be good for me to have a more casual book, which
y&rsquo;all should take as a huge indication that we, as a
family, take ourselves way to seriously. The first 60 or
so pages weren&rsquo;t the most fun to get through, but the
book moves into casual philosophizing at various aspects
of cross-country road travel. The ending wasn&rsquo;t great;
really, good while the story&rsquo;s moving (literally), not so
good while it&rsquo;s stagnant.</li>
<li><em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, Paulo Freire. I&rsquo;ve been
meaning to read this for ages, I biked to Third Place
Books in Seward Park to pick up a copy. Totally awesome,
situated qualitative work (or therapy) can be the tools of
the revolution.</li>
<li><em>The Princess Bride</em>, William Goldman. I was 100% duped
about the whole S. Morgenstern thing, but wonderful.</li>
<li><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone</em>, J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s kind of terrible, but the books were so integral to my childhood that I feel like I have to separate artists from work here. Also, the fandom&rsquo;s (claimed? reclaimed?) so much here: see <a href="https://ejadelomax.itch.io/sortinghatchats">the definitive Hogwarts House Quiz</a>, with <a href="https://sortinghatchats.wordpress.com/">explanations</a>. I picked up a used copy at <a href="http://www.buonobuzzard.com/">Couth Buzzard Books</a> in Greenwood back in August.</li>
<li><em>Dune</em>, Frank Herbert.</li>
<li><em>Race after Technology</em>, Ruja Benjamin</li>
<li><em>Transcending: Trans Buddhist Voices</em>, Edited by Manders and Marston</li>
<li><em>Sister Outsider</em>, Audre Lorde</li>
<li><em>The Fire Next Time</em>, James Baldwin</li>
<li><em>So You Want to Talk About Race</em>, Ijeoma Oluo</li>
<li><em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em>, Ted Chiang</li>
<li><em>How to be an Antiracist</em>, Ibrahm X. Kendi</li>
<li><em>How to do Nothing</em>, Jenny Odell</li>
<li><em>The Three Body Problem</em>, Cixin Liu. The whole series is awesome.</li>
<li><em>Altered Traits</em>, Daniel Goleman &amp; Richard J. Davidson</li>
<li><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>, Shoshana Zuboff</li>
<li><em>A People&rsquo;s History of the United States</em>, Howard Zinn</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s some joke or cliché about this, I&rsquo;m sure.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In defense, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/">CMU&rsquo;s phenomenal operating systems course</a> required a book report, but that course was most certainly an exception. I read someone&rsquo;s dissertation on storage optimizations, which, while fitting academic expectations of computing majors, was pretty removed from present social context. Even with academic-leaning books (<em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> for instance), there&rsquo;s something about the genre that requires a degree of ubiquity that goes well beyond a dissertation &ndash; there needs to be some explanatory power for folks outside one&rsquo;s field.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This was pre-adolescent Neil, books, music, and video games formed a nice little triad of escapism.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
