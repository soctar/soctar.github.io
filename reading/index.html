    <p>Much like <a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/computer-science-taught-me-that-books-werent-important-it-was-wrong-63ead2fdad7a">my advisor</a>, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get back into reading books after a hiatus implicitly imposed by engineering and computer science curricula<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and then by being busy.
A side effect of the double-whammy of quarantine and exploration of my gender expression/identity, however, is that I&rsquo;ve had to cut pretty much everything that doesn&rsquo;t give me space/energy/spoons during restful time so I don&rsquo;t have a meltdown halfway through the week. Oodles and oodles of fun. This hasn&rsquo;t been all bad &ndash; I&rsquo;m doing more yoga, meditation, tarot readings, basically a smörgåsbord of femme PNW actives (I know, I&rsquo;ve really come into my own).
TV&rsquo;s become a bit too overstimulating, unfort, as has <em>surfing the internet</em>, so I&rsquo;ve had to resort more to books and music than I have in a while<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been leaning away from Spotify towards <a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and so most of my music interests post-2015 are over there, but Goodreads is just so damn terrible; I just want a little virtual bookshelf that&rsquo;s not being scraped and productized. And, hey, I&rsquo;m proud of myself for finally getting into books, which feels like such a weird thing to say, but I&rsquo;ve had so many on and off points of reading in my life that I&rsquo;m really enjoying some stability here.</p>
<p><strong>If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not here that you think I&rsquo;d really enjoy, please <em>please</em> <a href="mailto:me@neildryan.com">let me know</a>!</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-im-reading-now">What I&rsquo;m Reading Now</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, Paulo Freire. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read this for ages, I biked to <a href="https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/seward-park">Third Place Books in Seward Park</a> to pick up a copy, so far, it&rsquo;s just the right amount of angry.</li>
<li><em>Breakfast with Buddha</em>, Roland Merullo. My mom thought that it&rsquo;d be good for me to have a more casual book, which y&rsquo;all should take as a huge indication that we, as a family, take ourselves way to seriously. The first 60 or so pages weren&rsquo;t the most fun to get through, but the book&rsquo;s moved into casual philosophizing at various aspects of cross-country road travel. Delightful and casual spiritualism, quite nice.</li>
<li><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone</em>, J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s kind of terrible, but the books were so integral to my childhood that I feel like I have to separate artists from work here. Also, the fandom&rsquo;s (claimed? reclaimed?) so much here: see <a href="https://ejadelomax.itch.io/sortinghatchats">the definitive Hogwarts House Quiz</a>, with <a href="https://sortinghatchats.wordpress.com/">explanations</a>. I picked up a used copy at <a href="http://www.buonobuzzard.com/">Couth Buzzard Books</a> in Greenwood back in August.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Mrs Dalloway</em>, Virginia Woolf. I&rsquo;ve had a copy lying around for a while and there&rsquo;s always been something I&rsquo;d rather read, and her writing&rsquo;s always such a trip that I haven&rsquo;t always had space for it. Soon™.</li>
<li><em>Dune Messiah</em>, Frank Herbert. <em>Dune</em> was awesome, I saw a copy at the <a href="https://www.ubookstore.com/">University Bookstore</a> on 9/4/20, talked with one of the folks working there about which books in the series were worth my time<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li><em>Galapagos</em>, Kurt Vonnegut</li>

<p>In defense, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/">CMU&rsquo;s phenomenal operating systems course</a> required a book report, but that course was most certainly an exception. I read someone&rsquo;s dissertation on storage optimizations, which, while fitting academic expectations of computing majors, was pretty removed from present social context. Even with academic-leaning books (<em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> for instance), there&rsquo;s something about the genre that requires a degree of ubiquity that goes well beyond a dissertation &ndash; there needs to be some explanatory power for folks outside one&rsquo;s field. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This was pre-adolescent Neil, books, music, and video games formed a nice little triad of escapism. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write something about this at some point, I have so many thoughts. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard lots of mixed reviews on Brian Herbert&rsquo;s contributions to the Dune universe, as well as Frank Herbert&rsquo;s last three books, but the Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune seem to have universal acclaim. I&rsquo;m sure that statement offended at least 40 people, I&rsquo;m sorry. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
