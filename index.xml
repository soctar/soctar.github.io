      <description>Neil-isms I&amp;rsquo;m not a parent and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I want kids, but I have this awesome image of myself as &amp;ldquo;your gender-neutral aunt linda&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to have some sayings that I get to say all the time. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fuck it up, so I&amp;rsquo;m preparing and curating a list. Your gender-netural aunt linda exits the room with; twitter bot incoming.

      <description>Much like my advisor1, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get back into reading books after a hiatus implicitly imposed by engineering and computer science curricula2, and then by being busy. A side effect of the double-whammy of quarantine and exploration of my gender expression/identity, however, is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to cut pretty much everything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give me space/energy/spoons during restful time so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a meltdown halfway through the week.</description>
